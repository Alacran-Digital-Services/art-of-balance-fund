<h3>
    I'm a software engineer, musician, and writer.
</h3>
<p>
    I like to solve problems, write music, share stories, and build systems that work.
    I think we all have a unique story to be told, and it is my passion to share those stories with the world and leave our legacy.
    I believe in authentic personal connections to unravel the incredible possibilities within each of us.
    I believe in embracing the future of technology for the <em>betterment and advancement of all humans.</em>
</p>
<p>
    I was born and raised in Chicago, IL, USA.

<p>Here are some of the benefits from building a website this way:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No heavy bogged down WordPress integrations or generic pre-built themes.</li>
    <li>Customize as much as I want.</li>
    <li>Quickly deploy updates to the cloud as soon as I merge to the main branch.</li>
    <li>It's all open source, and you can check it out here on <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jvmontes/basic-blog">Github</a>.</li>
