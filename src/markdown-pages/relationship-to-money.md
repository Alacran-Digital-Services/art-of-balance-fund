excerpt: "It all starts here. Understanding your relationship to money is one of the most important foundations you can have in life to make everything else easy or unnecessary."

Money. You either hate talking about it or love talking about it. If you love talking about it, it's because you don't have to worry about it and are happy with your relationship. If you hate talking about it, there's something standing in the way between you having a mastery of your own money situation or there's something you don't yet understand about how to make this relationship easier. 

The year is 2021, and we've been plunged into a situation few of us could've anticipated or been prepared for. I'll start this blog by talking a bit about my family and where we find ourselves financially, and I will dive into the basics of our foundation to money and how it impacts our lives. By the end of this post, you will have the tools to take ownership over your own money situation and have an idea of where to start to make moves in the right direction. 

1. Learn how to code. Where's the money? The money is in tech! Go where the money is!
2. Sell your services/goods online. E-commerce websites are extremely lucrative these days! Build a website to offer your skills, talents, knowledge, crafts, and goods to other!
3. Find a thriving business and work with them. If you need an extra influx of cash, work with Amazon as a delivery driver. 
4. If you find yourself with substaintial savings, invest your money. 


## How do you know if you have enough money saved?
Of course, this varies from person to person. As a rule of thumb, you want to have enough money in your savings account to account for 3-6 months of expenses if you were to lose your job.
