Made a huge accomplishment today!!

Today, I was able to get my blog posts (like this one) to dynamically load onto my home page! 

By adding some logic to my `layout.js`, I was able to use the result from my GraphQL query to get the markdown pages from my source filesystem to show up into blog previews, which link to the full blog in a separate page. 

From here, I need to add a link to navigate back to the list of blog posts, so the user can navigate back (outside of using the back arrow on their browser).

I'm pretty proud of the progress I've made to build this into a legitimate solution, and I am so happy with the tooling that is available to make this happen seamlessly.
